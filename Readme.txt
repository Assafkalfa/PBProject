Hello

The project is listen to the exec. output
And "doing" statistics.

Things to improve:
  1. Send data instead of text plain output
  2. Auto refresh the browser every X seconds/minutes (handle listeners)
  3. Add more info to the user (such as use the timestamp to calculate the delta between the events, etc.)

Regards,
   Assaf
